# cot-4500-as3
The purpose of this code is to complete the task assigned for the assignment 4 of COT 4500. To compile and run the file open the code into your IDE of choice and run the python code then it will give the desired outputs for the 6 questions of the assignment.

To run the code in command line open command prompt and then type C: pathway to the file with a .exe at the end and then in the same you put the C: path way again to the same file, but with .py at the end this time.

For example mine will be C:\Users\stewa\PycharmProjects\cot-4500_assignment1\venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\stewa\PycharmProjects\cot-4500_assignment2\assignment_3.py

by running this line in command prompt it will produce the outputs for the assignment.

All of the third party packages used are found in the requirements.txt file and include the versions used for this assignment

For this assignment no init.py files were used nor test_assignment_3.py because I did not need to use them and were unnecessary
